The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to the early and medieval history of the Islamic world, from the rise of Islam in Arabia to the formation of a world civilisation. Students will learn how to relate ideas to historical, geographical, and material factors. Particular attention will be paid to religious and cultural continuity, as a backdrop to the evolution of an Islamic identity and institutions of government, administration, and education. 1.1 Intended learning outcomes Students will learn about the most important developments in Islamic history, main questions in the historiography of Islam, and be able to reflect historically and critically about a range of topics related to the way Muslim societies functioned in the past. They will be able to find their way around major reference works for Islamic history and gain some familiarity with some primary sources. They will learn how to write critical essays following the conventions of style and referencing in the field of Islamic history. They will be able to apply the skills and methodological approaches to other subjects of study. They will be able to situate topics from Islamic studies in their historical context. They will gain exposure to innovative approaches to the study of medieval Islamicate history, digital methods and techniques, and will be able to use apply skills in other areas of their interests. 1.2 Lectures Weekly lectures will cover the period from the rise of Islam in Late Antiquity to the decline of the major caliphates and the appearances of new polities ruled mostly by non-Arabs, culminating with the Mongol invasion of the Middle East by the end of the 1250s CE. Each lecture will highlight historiographical issues, which will then be picked up during the seminars. 1.3 Seminars Seminars will follow the themes of the lectures but will expect input from students. For this, in addition to the discussion of secondary sources, students will be expected to engage with short excerpts from primary sources listed in the syllabus. Presentations will also take place during the seminars. To prepare for the seminars you must read the weekly readings listed first closely as these will provide you with the general framework.
