Each lecture will highlight historiographical issues, which will then be picked up during the seminars. Seminars Seminars will follow the themes of the lectures but will expect input from students. For this, in addition to the discussion of secondary sources, students will be expected to engage with short excerpts from primary sources listed in the syllabus. Presentations will also take place during the seminars. To prepare for the seminars you must read the weekly readings listed first closely as these will provide you with the general framework.

The main objective is to provide an introduction to pre-modern Islamicate education practices. Secondary readings are assigned to inform you of the main debates surrounding the role of knowledge and scholarly elite in medieval Islamicate society. Students will read some historical sources and examine manuscript evidence to get a closer understanding of the winterly culture in medieval Arabic and Persian engaging with the following: * The basic historical trajectory of educational practices in the Islamic world: origins, developments, and processes of formalization. * The role of knowledge networks and institutions of education in the formation of the Muslim world as we know it today. 11.1.1 Further points for discussion: The interpretation of primary sources (in English translation) related to practices of education and knowledge transmission. How digital methods can complement our reading of narrative sources, with a particular focus on Muslim knowledge transmission. 11.2 Slide one Image credit: Al-Turayya Project by Romanov and Seydi.
