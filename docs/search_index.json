Students will learn how to relate ideas to historical, geographical, and material factors. Particular attention will be paid to religious and cultural continuity, as a backdrop to the evolution of an Islamic identity and institutions of government, administration, and education. 1.1 Intended learning outcomes Students will learn about the most important developments in Islamic history, main questions in the historiography of Islam, and be able to reflect historically and critically. They should be able to find their way around major reference works for Islamic history and gain some familiarity with some primary sources. They will learn how to write critical essays following the conventions of style and referencing in the field of Islamic history. They will be able to apply the skills and methodological approaches to other subjects of study. They should be able to situate topics from Islamic studies in their historical context. 1.2 Lectures Weekly lectures will cover the period from the rise of Islam in Late Antiquity to the decline of the major caliphates and the appearances of new polities ruled mostly by non-Arabs. This historical shift is marked by the takeover of Baghdad by the Seljuq Turks on the one hand, and the breakup of Ifrīqiya (Tunisia) under the Berber Zirids from the Fatimid empire in 1050s on the other. Each lecture will highlight historiographical issues, which will then be picked up during the seminars. 1.3 Seminars Seminars will follow the themes of the lectures but will expect input from students. For this, in addition to the discussion of secondary sources, students will be expected to engage with short excerpts from primary sources listed in the syllabus. Presentations will also take place during the seminars. To prepare for the seminars you must read the weekly readings listed first closely as these will provide you with the general framework. Reading these will help you to be more selective about books and articles recommended for further reading. The short primary source readings are also essential for the seminars. All of this will help you with the exams. 1.4 Assessment Essay (50%), open-book exam (30%), presentation (15%), participation (5%). Essay, of maximum 2500 words. Essay questions will be drawn from the lectures and seminars topics and will be given one week before the submission date. You will be expected to be able to connect several topics and draw upon readings from several weeks, in addition to topic specific readings which will be provided with the questions. Open-book exam. The questions for open-book exam will be based on the list of books provided in the end of this syllabus. You will be asked to answer one of the questions within three hours, drawing on your knowledge of the course materials. The response must demonstrate a good overall understanding of the topics of Islamic history, an ability to select relevant material, and a close engagement with the selected books that you will have access to during the exam. You will not be penalised for poor referencing, spelling mistakes, and typos. Presentation. You will choose to present on one of the weekly topics, during one of the seminars. A strong presentation will combine a good understanding of the readings and an engaging and convincing use of material and archaeological evidence. Participation. It is essential to attend the lectures and seminars. You will be marked on your contributions to class discussions. 1.5 Resources and reading materials 1.5.1 Reference Works Bosworth, C. E.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter ??. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
