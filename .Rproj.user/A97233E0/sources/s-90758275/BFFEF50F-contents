This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

``` {r}
library(tidyverse)

year <- seq(800, 1800, 100)
period <- c("Middle Ages", "Middle Ages", "Middle Ages", "Middle Ages", "Middle Ages",
             "Middle Ages", "Middle Ages", "Modern Times", "Modern Times", "Modern Times",
             "Modern Times")
periods <- tibble(year, period)

periods %>%
  mutate(periodsNovo = ifelse(year >= 800 & year < 900, "9th century",
                          ifelse(year >= 900 & year < 1000, "10th century",
                                 ifelse(year >= 1000 & year < 1100, "11th century", "eleventh-nineteenth centuries"))))

``` 


``` {r} 


#for tibble we must construct vectors of simialr size, so the sequance must correspond top the period vector.
# This can get complicated with long seq such as years, in which case we get rid of the period vector and use conditional

long_years <- seq(800, 1800, 1)
periodsNew <- tibble(long_years)
periodsNew %>%
  mutate(periodsNewcolumn= ifelse(long_years >= 800 & long_years < 900, "9th century",
                          ifelse(long_years >= 900 & long_years < 1000, "10th century",
                                 ifelse(long_years >= 1000 & long_years < 1100, "11th century", "eleventh-nineteenth centuries"))))

# 6.4.1 SECTION I.
Please, provide your answers (2-3 sentences) to the following questions:

## Can you figure which file contains data?


In which format is data?
How can we load it into R? (Describe and provide working R code)
What is the chronological extent of this data?
[easy-ish] What periods can it be divided into? How can we do that?
How can we introduce the following categories into this data:
[easy] North Africa and Europe?
[a bit more complicated] the Ottoman Empire?
[a tad tricky] Christiandom and Islamdom?
6.4.2 SECTION II
Please, provide your answers as working R code and a couple of sentences to describe how you approach (2-3 sentences) the following problems:

What is the chronological extent of this data?
[easy-ish] What periods can it be divided into? How can we do that?
Can you generate a cumulative graph of population over time, divided into these periods? (Hint: there should be one line for one period and another for another, etc.)
How can we introduce the following categories into this data:
[easy] North Africa and Europe?
Construct comparative graphs of population in North Africa and Europe (similar to what you did with the Morris dataset). Here you will need to sum up population!
[a bit more complicated] the Ottoman Empire?
When did the Empire had the largest number of cities (based on the data set)?
When was its population at the highest?
[a tad tricky] Christiandom and Islamdom?
What are the largest cities of Islamdom for each reported period?
What are the largest western cities of Islamdom between 1000 and 1500 CE?
